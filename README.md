# Python_core_tuple
A tuple is an immutable sequence of items, which means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. Tuples are similar to lists, but with the key difference of immutability. Tuples are useful for grouping related data together and for situations where you want to ensure that the data cannot be modified.
